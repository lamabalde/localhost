_The demo configuration will give you these following routes:_
- `/api/update-cookie` - _Handler to update a cookie on the server_
- `/api/get-cookie` - _Handler to get a cookie from the server_
- `/api/cookie-demo` - _Dynamic session demo_
- `/cgi` - _Demo path for implemented CGI_
- `/files` - _Access anything you want in the /files directory. Highly recommend to remove this endpoint in production._
- `/test.txt` - _Used for testing files on the server_
- `/test-dir` - _Used for testing directories on the server_
